Good News for all people interested in IDAscope.  
I submitted the extension to the [Hex-Rays contest][ida contest] two days ago and today I want to follow up promises and release a first public version. 
 
You can find the repository we will use to publish future updates here: 
 
[bitbucket repo][https://bitbucket.org/daniel_plohmann/simplifire.idascope/]
 
There is a prepared [download for version 1.0[bitbucket zip]. You can also checkout via `git` from the repo (right now they have the same content). 
 
For installation instructions, feature description and usage, check out the manual located in *IDAscope/documentation/manual/*. 
 
A big **THANK YOU** to all people who did a beta test of IDAscope. You provided very helpful feedback!  
 
We hope it turns out to be an useful addition to IDA Pro. Development does not stop here of course, as we plan to continue the project to integrate more features. 
 
We are open to feedback, so don't hesitate to tell us your opinion! 
 
<span style="color: red;">UPDATE 18.09.2012: There was a bug in the initial release that has been fixed. Check out the [following blog post]({% post_url 2012-09-18-idascope-fixed %}) for details and a new feature!</span>
