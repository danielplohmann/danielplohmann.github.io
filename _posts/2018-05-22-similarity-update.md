Good day!

I've spent a couple hours to update the Big Zeus Family Similarity Rundown, now including almost twice as many samples.

First, I would like to thank [Maciej Kotowicz][twitter mak] and [Dennis Schwarz][twitter dennis] for both their valuable input and contributions to the data from which this analysis was created.

The Rundown now includes 99 versions of 14 families (before: 52 versions of 10 families).
Thanks to many contributions in Malpedia, I was able to increase the coverage of PandaBanker massively. With the additions to VMZeus, their direct connection and code evolution now is way more obvious.

Here is a preview, but you probably want to check out the data on its [dedicated page][pnx tf static link].
